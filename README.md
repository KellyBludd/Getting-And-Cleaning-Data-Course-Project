# Getting-And-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository contains my work done for the Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 course project. 
The data required is here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The run_analysis.R script which can be used to assemble the complete data set for mean and standard deviation variables and will write the final tidy data set to your working directory.  Note that the UCI HAR Dataset folder needs to be extracted to your working directory for the script to work. 
There is a CodeBook.md file that explains the variables and the work done to assemble and clean the data
To load the tidy data set, you can use the following command: read.table("TidyDataSet.txt") from your working directory.
